# Cat Dog Training Network (CDTN)

Please use the code:

python catdog.py config.yaml

to train a CNN model on a cats and dogs dataset.
You must download the dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats) and place it in the same folder as the python script file.
Preprocessing and train/test separation will be done automatically by the python script file.
You can either use config.yaml or specify hyper-parameters in your own configuration file.
